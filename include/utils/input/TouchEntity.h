/*
 * TouchEntity.h
 *
 *  Brief: used to mark a class than inherits this class as a TouchEntity.
 *
 *         Motivation: Engine needs to remember, which was the last pressed
 *         TouchEntity object in order to perform correct event actions.
 *
 *         Event newly selected TouchEntity will have to operate with one of
 *         the following actions:
 *              > PRESS;
 *              > DRAG;
 *              > RELEASE;
 *
 *         On selecting a new TouchEntity that is different than the
 *         previously selected one an action onLeave() will be invoked for the
 *         old TouchEntity.
